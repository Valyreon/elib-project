**ELib** is a project I started at university as part of a course but I decided to finish it for personal use. It's created using .NET 6 and WPF. The idea is to have a basic ebook manager, sort of like a dumbed down version of Calibre.

It will allow users to specify source folder that will be scanned for files of specific extensions and imported into the SQLite database. User can then customize Authors and book Series, organize books into Collections etc. There will be a possibility of exporting books to a specified location and with some specific settings such as grouping by author/series. The app will also use an ebook parser to extract information from imported books such as their cover, title, authors, description, also there will be an option to use OpenLibrary API to try to fetch book details.

The app development is still in progress but here are some current screenshots:
